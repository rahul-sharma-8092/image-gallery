# Image Gallery

This mini project is an image gallery built using React, where users can view a set of images fetched from a given API. The gallery displays thumbnails of the images along with their relevant details. When a user clicks on a thumbnail, they are redirected to a single image view, where the image is shown in a larger view, along with its title and description.

## Requirements

-   Node.js and npm should be installed on your system to run this application.
-   Create a new React application using create-react-app or any preferred React boilerplate.
-   Implement a gallery component that displays the first 20 images fetched from the server. Each image will be displayed with a thumbnail and relevant details.
-   Add functionality to handle user interaction. Clicking on any thumbnail in the gallery should redirect the user to a new page showing the single image in a larger view.
-   On the single image page, display the enlarged image along with its title and description.
-   Use React Router Dom to handle navigation between the gallery and single image view.
-   Ensure error handling for cases where the server request fails or returns no images.
